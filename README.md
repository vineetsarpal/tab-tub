# TabTub

Effortlessly manage your browser tabs with TabTub ‚Äì a simple yet powerful Chrome extension designed to help you organize and revisit important links with ease.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Quick Tab Capture:** Instantly save your current active tab or all open tabs to your personal "tub."
*   **Intuitive Management:** Easily remove individual tabs or clear your entire tub with a single click.
*   **Cross-Device Sync:** Your saved tabs automatically sync across all Chrome browsers where you're signed in, thanks to `chrome.storage.sync`.
*   **Visual Tub:** A clear visual representation of your saved tabs, making organization straightforward.
*   **Duplicates Prevention:** Avoid clutter; the "Tub 'em All" feature intelligently prevents adding tabs that are already in your tub.

## üí° Usage

TabTub provides a streamlined way to keep your browsing organized:

*   **Tub It:** Click this button to save the tab you are currently viewing into your tub.
*   **Tub 'em All:** Save all tabs from your current browser window into the tub. Duplicate URLs are automatically ignored.
*   **Empty Tub:** Clear all saved tabs from your tub. A confirmation prompt ensures you don't accidentally delete your collection.
*   **Remove Individual Tab (X):** Each tab in the tub has a small 'X' button to remove it individually.
